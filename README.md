# Interface Lab

In this activity, we'll refactor an existing app to include an interface type.

To get started:

1. Clone or Download this Repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to run the server.
4. Adjust the `index.js` file to include interface types based on the data.
